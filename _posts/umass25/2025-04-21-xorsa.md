## Challenge Overview

- **CTF**: UMASSCTF
- **Challenge**: XORSA
- **Category**: Crypto
- **Points**: 488 (19 solves)
- **Description**: I leaked a bit more than half of the XOR of the primes.

## TL;DR

This challenge involved exploiting a vulnerability in an RSA implementation where the creator leaked more than half of the XOR of the prime factors. We constructed a solution that bit-by-bit reconstructed the prime factors. The solve implements a recursive approach that starts with the most significant bits and works downward, using the leaked XOR bits to guide prime factor recovery. At each step, we check possible bit combinations that satisfy the $$p \oplus q$$ constraint and prune search paths that can't produce the known modulus $$n$$. Once enough bits are recovered, we use lattice reduction to solve for the remaining bits, compute the private key, and decrypt the flag.

## Initial Analysis

The challenge provides us with this code:

```python
from Crypto.Util import number
flag = b"REDACTED"
bits = 1024
p = number.getPrime(bits)
q = number.getPrime(bits)
n = p * q
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
e = 65537
d = number.inverse(e, phi)
extra = 75
c = pow(int.from_bytes(flag, 'big'), e, n)
print(f"n: {hex(n)}")
print(f"e: {hex(e)}")
print(f"c: {hex(c)}")
print(f"partial p^q: {hex((p^q) >> (bits // 2 - extra))}")
```

At first glance, this appears to be a standard RSA encryption implementation with:
- Two 1024-bit primes $$p$$ and $$q$$
- A modulus $$n = p \cdot q$$
- Public exponent $$e = 65537$$
- Ciphertext $$c$$

But there's something unusual: the script leaks  

$$\boldsymbol{\text{partial } p \oplus q: \text{hex}((p \oplus q) \gg (\text{bits} // 2 - \text{extra}))}$$. 
  
This means we're getting a significant portion of the XOR of $$p$$ and $$q$$, specifically the most significant $$\text{bits}/2 + \text{extra}$$ bits (where $$\text{extra} = 75$$).
This is a serious information leak. In a properly implemented RSA, any information about the relationship between $$p$$ and $$q$$ should be kept secret.

Using a simple Google search, we find this relevant discussion: [Integer factorization with additional knowledge of $$p \oplus q$$](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2087588/integer-factorization-with-additional-knowledge-of-p-oplus-q/2087589)

According to this resource, knowing the full XOR of primes can lead to efficient factorization. As the answer states:

> Consider this factoring algorithm; we track the set of $$k$$ bit values $$p_k, q_k$$ that satisfy $$p_k \cdot q_k \equiv n \pmod{2^k}$$; for each iteration, we attempt to extend $$p_k, q_k$$ by one bit, generating 0-4 possible solutions $$p_{k+1}, q_{k+1}$$ that satisfy $$p_{k+1} \cdot q_{k+1} \equiv n \pmod{2^{k+1}}$$.
>
> However, if we add the additional constraint that $$p_k \oplus q_k = m$$ (where $$m$$ is the known value of $$p \oplus q$$), this drastically reduces the number of intermediate solutions.

However, the original factoring approach (found in [xor_factor](https://github.com/sliedes/xor_factor)) recovers $$p$$ and $$q$$ bit by bit from the LSB upwards, which requires knowing all bits. In our case, we only know the MSB portion.

## Task Analysis

Let's think about what we know:
1. We have the MSB portion of $$p \oplus q$$ (specifically $$\text{bits}/2 + 75$$ most significant bits)
2. We know $$n = p \cdot q$$
3. We need to recover $$p$$ and $$q$$ to decrypt the flag

The key insight is that we need to modify the approach to work from MSB down to LSB.

At each bit position starting from the MSB:
- We know the XOR value for this bit from our leaked data
- We try each valid combination:
  - If $$p \oplus q = 0$$, try $$(0,0)$$ or $$(1,1)$$ for $$(p_{\text{bit}}, q_{\text{bit}})$$
  - If $$p \oplus q = 1$$, try $$(0,1)$$ or $$(1,0)$$ for $$(p_{\text{bit}}, q_{\text{bit}})$$

But we need a way to prune invalid paths early. Here's where the brilliance comes in: for each potential choice of bits, we can check if the product of $$p$$ and $$q$$ could possibly equal $$n$$:

Once we've reached the point where we've used all leaked XOR bits, we can use Coppersmith's method to find the remaining bits. This works because we're now looking for "small" roots relative to the bits we've already fixed.


## Exploitation

Here's our complete solution:

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from sage.all import *
import sys
load('coppersmith.sage')

b = 1024
xor = 0x64...
n = 0x46...
e = 0x10001
c = 0x38...

def find(k, p_high, q_high):
    l = p_high.bit_length()
    if k < b//2 - 75:
        l = 512 - 75
        R = 2**l
        x, y = var('x y')
        p_ = p_high * R + x
        q_ = q_high * R + y
        f = (p_ * q_ - n).expand()
        PR = PolynomialRing(Zmod(n), names=('x', 'y'))
        f = PR(f)
        try:
            x, y = small_roots(f, [R, R], m=3, d=4)[0]
            P = int(p_high * R + x)
            Q = int(q_high * R + y)
            if n % P == 0:
                phi = (P - 1) * (Q - 1)
                d = inverse(e, phi)
                m = pow(c, d, n)
                print(long_to_bytes(m))
                sys.exit(0)
        except:
            pass
        return

    xor_k = (xor >> (k - b//2 + 75)) & 1
    possibilities = [(0, 0), (1, 1)] if xor_k == 0 else [(0, 1), (1, 0)]
    
    for p_k, q_k in possibilities:
        p_high_new = (p_high << 1) | p_k
        q_high_new = (q_high << 1) | q_k
        m = NBITS - k
        shift = NBITS - m
        min_prod = (p_high_new << shift) * (q_high_new << shift)
        max_prod = ((p_high_new << shift) + (1 << shift) - 1) * ((q_high_new << shift) + (1 << shift) - 1)
        
        if min_prod <= n <= max_prod:
            find(k - 1, p_high_new, q_high_new)

NBITS = b
find(NBITS - 1, 0, 0)
```

The algorithm works as follows:

1. We start with the most significant bit and recursively work our way down
2. For each bit position, we check both possibilities allowed by the $$p \oplus q$$ constraint
3. We prune the search space using min/max product bounds
4. Once we've used all the leaked XOR bits, we switch to Coppersmith's method
5. With both primes recovered, we compute the private key and decrypt the flag

## Behind the Math

Let's dive a little deeper into why this approach works:

1. **Exploiting the XOR constraint**: The XOR of $$p$$ and $$q$$ gives us valuable information. For each bit position, if $$p \oplus q = 0$$, then either both bits are 0 or both are 1. If $$p \oplus q = 1$$, then one bit must be 0 and the other must be 1.

2. **Min/Max bounds**: This is the key insight. For any partially constructed $$p_{\text{high}}$$ and $$q_{\text{high}}$$:
   - If all remaining bits are 0, the product would be:
     $$p_{\text{high}} \cdot q_{\text{high}} \ll (2 \cdot \text{shift})$$
   - If all remaining bits are 1, the product would be at most:
        ![Equation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hhhh.png)
   - If $$n$$ falls outside this range, this path cannot lead to the correct factorization

3. **Coppersmith's method**: Once we've determined a significant portion of $$p$$ and $$q$$, the remaining bits form a "small" root of the polynomial $$f(x,y) = (p_{\text{high}} \cdot R + x) \cdot (q_{\text{high}} \cdot R + y) - n$$. Lattice-based methods like LLL can efficiently find these small roots.

After running the above solve script for around 10 minutes we get the flag: `UMASS{i_will_make_a_solve_script}`

## Conclusions

What we learned in this challenge:

1. **Information leakage matters**: Even partial information about the relationship between $$p$$ and $$q$$ can completely break RSA.
2. **Bit-by-bit reconstruction**: Constraints like $$p \oplus q$$ can guide an efficient search process.
3. **Lattice techniques are powerful**: Coppersmith's method effectively solves the "small roots" problem once we've constrained the solution space.

This challenge elegantly combines number theory, constraint satisfaction, and lattice-based cryptanalysis to demonstrate a practical attack against leaked RSA parameters.
